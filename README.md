# TegraScript
The scripting language of TegraExplorer

Notice: TegraScript v2 is entirely different than v1. If you still have v1 scripts, you'll have to rewrite them.

## General Syntax

### Variables

Variables in TegraScript do not need explicit type definitions:
```
variable = function(arg1, arg2) # this calls function with 2 arguments: arg1 and arg2, and stores it in variable
```

Variables can be of the following types:
- Integer
- String
- Integer Array
- String Array
- Byte Array

Creating and accessing Array variables goes as follows:
```
variable = [1,2,3,4,5] # This creates an integer array and stores it into variable
function(variable[2]) # This calls function with 1 argument, index 2 of variable, which is 3
```

In tegrascript, operations are evaluated from left to right. This is important for math type operations. See the operator section for what type definitions you can put operators against. As a quick primer:
```
variable = 2 + 2 * 2 # This puts 8 into variable, as the calculations get evaluated from left to right
variable = 2 + (2 * 2) # But! we can also use brackets to prioritise calculations
variable = "a" + "b" # Adding 2 strings together is also a supported operator
```

Note: Minus integer values are supported this time around

Another note: You can do !variable to flip the integer inside

Every variable in TegraScript v2 is global, thus you can access any variable in any self-defined function

### Built in variables

TegraScript has 2 built in variables.
- `_CWD`, which is a string, and represents the current working directory, thus the directory the currently running script is in.
- `_EMU`, which is an int, and represents if an emummc is present. 1 for present, 0 for not present

When running `dirRead()` as a function, besides returning a list of filenames, also sets an integer array called `fileProperties` that holds if the representing index of the filenames is a folder or not. 1 for a folder, 0 for a file

### Functions

TegraScript has support for functions

Defining and using a function goes as follows:
```
function = { # We are defining a function called function here, with the {}
    # We put the code we want to run inside the function here
    var = 1 + 2 + 3
}

function() # after running this, variable will be set to 6
```

But you may see an issue: there are no arguments! Fear not, as every variable in TegraScript is global. You can thus solve it with the following syntax:
```
function = {
    b = a * 2 # We want to multiply a by 2 and put it into b, but how do we define a?
}

function(a = 10) # Ah! We can just define it in the function args

a = 20
function() # Or if you prefer, you can define it normally as well
```

### Flow control

TegraScript has the following functions for flow control: `if()`, `else()`, `while()`, `return()`, `exit()`

- `if()` checks it's first arg, if it's 1, it runs the next {}, otherwise it skips over it
- `else()` checks if the last statement was an if, and if that if skipped, we run the next {}
- `while()` checks it's first arg, if it's 1, it runs the next {}, and jumps back to the while
- `return()` exits the current running function, if there is one
- `exit()` exits the script entirely

Lets try to build a loop that iterates 30 times, and printing even numbers
```
i = 0
while (i < 30){ # check if i is below 30, if so, run the code between the brackets
    if (i % 2 == 0){ # is i dividable by 2?
        println(i)
    }

    i = i + 1 # don't forget the + 1 of i! otherwise an infinite loop will haunt you
}
```

## Operators

### Integer, Integer
Operator | Output
|:-|:-|
`+` | sum of both integers
`-` | integer minus integer
`*` | multiplication of both integers
`/` | integer divided by integer
`%` | integer division remainder (modulo) of integer
`<` | 1 if left is smaller, otherwise 0
`>` | 1 if left is bigger, otherwise 0
`<=`| 1 if left is smaller or equal, otherwise 0
`>=`| 1 if left is bigger or equal, otherwise 0
`==`| 1 if left and right are equal, otherwise 0
`!=`| 1 if left and right are not equal, otherwise 0
`&&`| 1 if left and right are non 0, otherwise 0. Also if output is 0, disregards rest of statement
`\|\|`| 1 if left or right are non 0, otherwise 0. Also if output is 1, disregards rest of statement
`&` | Binary operator. ANDs both integers together
`\|` | Binary operator. ORs both integers together

`>>`| Binary operator. Bitshifts the left integer to the right by right integer's amount

### String, String
Operator | Output
|:-|:-|
`+` | Adds both strings together
`==`| 1 if strings are equal, otherwise 0
`-` | Removes the end of the first string if the second string matches the end of the first. (Example: `"abcdef" - "def"` is `"abc"`)
`/` | Splits the left string based on the right string. Returns a string array

### (Integer Array, Byte Array), Integer
Operator | Output
|:-|:-|
`+` | Adds the right integer into the left array
`-` | Removes right integer amount of entries from the left array
`:` | Removes right integer amount of entries from the beginning of the left array

### String, Integer
Operator | Output
|:-|:-|
`-` | Removes right integer amount of characters from the left string
`:` | Removes right integer amount of character from the beginning of the left string
